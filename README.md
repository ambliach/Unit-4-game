Approaching this assignment, I was unsure of how If statements worked, how to make them do what I want. I quickly learned setting variables to start was good pratice, so i begin by storing those win/losses into values. THe hardest part was how to generate a random number, which I used w3 schools and stack to direct me to the solution math.floor(math.random()
once this number was generated and set to a variable, i then created a for statement that operated on the random number and set it to variable for later use for the crystals. I then created a function for a new random crstal number using these previously created variables, and finally made on click events for different circumstances of the game.
